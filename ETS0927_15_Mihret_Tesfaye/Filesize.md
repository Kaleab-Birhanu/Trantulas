Input:

- File size in bytes

      Output:

- Time taken to send the file in seconds

       Process:

1. Prompt the user to enter the file size in bytes.

2. Calculate the time taken to send the file using the formula: time_taken = file_size / 960.

3. Display the time taken to send the file.

. ALGORITHM IN PSEDOCODE

Step1: start

Step 2: Read the file size 


Step 3: Set the transmission rate in characters per second to 960 

Step 4: timeInSeconds ïƒŸ fileSizeInBytes / transmissionRate

Step 5. Output or display the "time_seconds" to the user.

Step 6: stop
