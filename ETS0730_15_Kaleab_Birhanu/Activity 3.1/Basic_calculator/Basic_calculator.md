 pseudocode

    1. Declare character variables 'op' and 'exitcode'

    2. Declare float variables 'num1' and 'num2'

    3. Do the following steps in a loop until 'exitcode' is '0':

         a. Prompt the user to enter the first number and store it in 'num1'

         b. Prompt the user to enter an operator and store it in 'op'

         c. Prompt the user to enter the second number and store it in 'num2'

         d. Perform the operation based on the value of 'op':

            1. If 'op' is '+', output the sum of 'num1' and 'num2'

            2. If 'op' is '-', output the difference of 'num1' and 'num2'

            3 If 'op' is '*', output the product of 'num1' and 'num2'

            4. If 'op' is '/', check if 'num2' is not zero:

                  4.1. If 'num2' is not zero, output the division of 'num1' by 'num2'

                  4.2. If 'num2' is zero, output "undefined operation !"

            5. If 'op' is none of the above, output "Invalid operator!"

         e. Prompt the user to enter '0' to exit or any other key to continue and store it in 'exitcode'
     5. End
